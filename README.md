# Stock Market Forecasting: Predicting the Next Big Move

## 📌 Project Description
Stock market forecasting is one of the most complex and challenging problems in data science and finance. This project aims to predict future stock price movements or trends based on historical stock data using time-series forecasting techniques. The goal is to identify patterns that help forecast market behaviour, such as predicting price increases, decreases, or volatility.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Develop a model that can analyze historical stock data and forecast future stock price movements. The solution should leverage various time-series forecasting techniques and evaluate prediction accuracy using suitable metrics.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack / Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras, Prophet, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Example sources: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl, Kaggle datasets  
- This repository includes: `RLIN Historical Data (1).csv`  

## 🔍 Methodology / Models Used
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)  
- Prophet (for trend forecasting)  
- Moving averages and statistical models  

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Market-Forecasting-Predicting-the-Next-Big-Move.git
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Run the notebook Stock_market_forecasting.ipynb step by step.

## 📊 Results & Visualizations
- Plots comparing predicted vs. actual stock prices
- Evaluation metric results (MAE, RMSE, etc.)

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement ensemble models (stacking, hybrid boosting)
- Add attention-based deep learning models
- Integrate real-time stock data feeds
